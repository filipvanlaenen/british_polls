1. Mark the median in the graph with the voting intentions with two outward ticks
   or a line
1. Mark the median in the graph with the seat projections with two outward ticks
   or a line
1. Mark the median in the graph with the seat projections for coalitions with
   two outward ticks or a line
1. Add a graph with the probability per number of seats and the accumulation
   + Bars for the probability per number of seats
   + A line showing the accumulation
   + Mark last election's result
   + Mark accumulation crossing 50%
   + Mark the 80%, 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals
1. Add to the methodology page:
   + Weighted Monte Carlo simulations
   + Calculation of the error estimate
   + Concept of a confidence interval
   + Seat probabilities not following a bell curve, and the accumulation column
1. Add a legend to the graph with the voting intentions explaining the filled
   and the hatched areas and the red line

   (including its legend)
1. Add last election's results to the graph with the seat projections (including
   its legend)
